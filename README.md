## Description

In this project we have built a website that allows everyone to choose which planets they want to travel between and on which date. Then it gives users an option to book for multiple people by selecting the number of people travelling. It provides the user with three spaceship options - one being the cheapest and longest journey, one a little faster, and the final option being a private spaceship. Users can then make a payment on the app and ask for the details being sent to them via SMS.

## Inspiration

FuTourist is made in 2150 where travelling to any intergalactic planet is possible. Our inspiration for this was every Marvel, DC Comics, Star Wars and Star Trek movie ever made. The beauty of the space and the dream of becoming an astronaut as a child is what inspired us to make this hack for Hack for the Future. We imagine that in 2150 every human would be able to travel to space by easily booking through our site!


## Tech Used

**Frontend:** React, Daisy UI (a Tailwind CSS plugin)

**Backend:** Node.js, twilio for sending messages/booking details

We used the Issues and PR feature of GitHub to divide the tasks into manageable chunks and push code periodically. We have also hosted the frontend on Github Pages. The sending details via SMS feature was possible thanks to Twilio.
