## Description

In this project we have built a website in which you can pick a date of travel, choose your favourite spaceline, your favourite spaceship and your favourite destination planet.
Since the design is futuristic the dates will be from 2150. We have also created an SMS system using Twilio where you will get a message on your registered mobile number once your ticket is confirmed.

## Tech Used

**Frontend:** React, Daisy UI (a Tailwind CSS plugin)

**Backend:** Node.js, twilio for sending messages/booking details
